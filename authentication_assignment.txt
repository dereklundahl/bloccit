> For this assignment, read more about the different 
strategies available for authenticating with Passport. 
Pick a strategy to study and write a high-level 
explanation of how it works. This explanation does not
need to be technical.

A: I decided to study the facebook strategy. It seems that
other than using a direct password creation, that facebook
is one of the most popular sign in options. Google seems
fairly popular as well.

The first step in using passport with facebook is to 
register the application with facebook. When you register
you will recieve an app Id and an app secret.

Although I have not tried using it yet, the facebook
strategy seems fairly simple. It uses the secret and Id provided
when regerstering the app as well as a callback URL
in the passport.use call. It then uses access and refresh
tokens to authenticate the user.

In addition to getting the users id, other fields needed
by the app can be specified in the profileFields property
in the initial passport.use call.
